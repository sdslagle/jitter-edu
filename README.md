# jitter-edu
A repository for my original creative coding course from 2004 at the San Francisco Art Institute, and later at California College of Art. Some files may need to have the extensions updated to ".maxpat" instead of ".pat" since Adobe eventually made that the pattern file extension. This was the first Jitter class ever, since I was an alpha-tester of that branch of Cycling 74's software I had early access to many things that others did not. I also started using Jitter for live performance and video processing around this time - making me well-positioned to teach creative coding to artists. TBH it was not easy to learn and I am still passionate about teaching beginners because I remember being one so vividly.
